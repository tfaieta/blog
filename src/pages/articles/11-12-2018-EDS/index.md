# **Introduction**
**This is a draft of a final project for an Election Data Science class I took my junior year at the University of Florida, this class was taught by [Michael McDonald](https://twitter.com/ElectProject).**

**For the past couple of elections, I have spent some time reading about how social media has played a role in our elections and more specifically how it's helping or hurting political campaigns. Through my research, I have found some rather alarming ways that political campaigns are using artificial intelligence, and how some companies are offering platform-as-a-service software to political campaigns.**

**I argue that campaigns that use these tactics receive much higher engagements than those who do not, but that these practices can be extremely effective at catching key platform issues, hence the term 'platform-as-a-service' coined from the software-as-a-service term.**


## **Case Study**

Locally, a startup in Gainesville named CharlotteAI, created a technology that uses artificial intelligence to create high engagement Facebook ads at the lowest price. One of the ways that they sell that technology is by consulting with political campaigns to discover issues that are commonly talked about on Facebook in a certain area. Through their service, they are able to identify issues that resonate deeply with constituents and deliver that as a platform to a political campaign. 

Their latest client was the recently elected mayor of Apopka, Bryan Nelson. Through getting in contact with CharlotteAI I was able to receive the data set that was used to identify the most talked about issues in the population segment that they used to help with Nelson's campaign. Nelson's staff had original given them a list of possible terms that they might want to test as main points that their campaign wanted to drive home, I was not given this list but was told that none of the terms given to CharlotteAI were in the top trends. 

Below is a graph of those:
