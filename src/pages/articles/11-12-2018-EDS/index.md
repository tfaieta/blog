## **Introduction**
This is a draft of a final project for an Election Data Science class I took my junior year at the University of Florida, this class was taught by Michael McDonald.
For the past couple of elections, I have spent some time reading about how social media has played a role in our elections and more specifically how it's helping or hurting political campaigns. Through my research, I have found some rather alarming (and possibly illegal) ways that political campaigns are using artificial intelligence, and how some companies are offering platform-as-a-service software to political campaigns. 
The immediate danger lies in the way that this can be 


## **Case Study**
The lines between political influence and social media have been blurred through campaigns of well-targeted ad campaigns, internet trolls, and data analyzation. What many do not know is that those three mediums are mostly driven by artificially intelligent "bots" or script injections made by software companies. These bots, which are usually pieces of software written to perform commands as many times as needed without human supervision, query users with content repeatedly. Today they are producing mass changes in common beliefs and can gather data that can influence potential voters, offering political campaigns unfair advantages. Multiple companies that offer bot and marketing AI solutions are now turning to political campaigns as key customers and the number of companies offering these solutions is growing rapidly as these solutions are not particularly complex to develop. My goal for this project is to compare the results of campaigns that use AI solutions versus those that do not in terms of voter engagement, budget spent, demographics affected, and other key factors I may deem important.

Even locally, a startup in Gainesville called CharlotteAI, provides Facebook marketing optimization using AI to query Facebook Ad campaigns to their maximum engagement rates while keeping costs low. One of CharlotteAI's first use case gave Bryan Nelson, the newly elected Mayor of Apopka, FL, a surprising advantage to key topics that his target audience were highly engaged with. As this is just one of many companies offering AI social media marketing solutions, it is important to document the effects of AI in political campaign advertisements because if there is no control or knowledge of how these pieces of software are being used then there will be no control in the sector. If uncontrolled, political campaigns could become bidding wars for software companies offering AI marketing solutions. Another possibility is the rise of political campaigns with candidates that are metaphorically given the "answers" to creating an engaging platform, which could lead to more politicians that do not care for their constituents, although a more far-fetched idea, it is still a possibility.

The most important factor that an analysis like this can bring to life is the actual process by which this is happening, social media giants (more prominently, Facebook and Twitter) are allowing bots to inject scripts into their ad platforms that allow an unfair advantage to those buying ads manually. Essentially, I would call this hacking and unethical practice of AI because of the unfair nature that the AI gives to those who use it. Soon, if not already, if a campaign is not using a bot to query the engagement rates of content, social media marketing will be considerably less effective. I'm also going to look into other AI software solutions that are giving political campaigns unfair advantages. My background in writing artificial intelligence software also gives me a good idea between the complexity of some of these solutions and how replicable they are which can give us a better understanding of how long it might be until the market is inundated. This topic is of interest to me because I believe that AI shouldn't be something that is offered as a service for markets of influence, similar to OpenAI's point of view on providing safe and open artificial intelligence practices.
