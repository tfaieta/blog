# **Introduction**
**This is a draft of a final project for an Election Data Science class I took my junior year at the University of Florida, this class was taught by [Michael McDonald](https://twitter.com/ElectProject).**

**For the past couple of elections, I have spent some time reading about how social media has played a role in our elections and more specifically how it's helping or hurting political campaigns. Through my research, I have found some rather alarming ways that political campaigns are using artificial intelligence, and how some companies are offering platform-as-a-service software to political campaigns.**

**I argue that campaigns that use these tactics receive much higher engagements than those who do not, but that these practices can be extremely effective at catching key platform issues, hence the term 'platform-as-a-service' coined from the software-as-a-service term.**

## **Case Study**

Locally, a startup in Gainesville named CharlotteAI, created a technology that uses artificial intelligence to create high engagement Facebook ads at the lowest price. One of the ways that they sell that technology is by consulting with political campaigns to discover issues that are commonly talked about on Facebook in a certain area. Through their service, they are able to identify issues that resonate deeply with constituents and deliver that as a platform to a political campaign. 

Their latest client was the recently elected mayor of Apopka, Bryan Nelson. Through getting in contact with CharlotteAI I was able to receive the data set that was used to identify the most talked about issues in the population segment that they used to help with Nelson's campaign. Nelson's staff had original given them a list of possible terms that they might want to test as main points that their campaign wanted to drive home, I was not given this list but was told that none of the terms given to CharlotteAI were in the top trends. 

Below is a bar graph that shows popular repeating trends according to the data by the amount of times they popped up in the data set:

After this, CharlotteAI then does another scan of the data in order to gain more insight on the popular words to classify them into having negative (against) or positive (for) connotation trends in order to present those as possible ad campaigns and platform items. Going further into this case study, the technology was able to clearly identify that the red light traffic cameras was something that many people in the area had a real distaste for. CharlotteAI ran with that and created an ad campaign that pushed for the abolishment of red light traffic cameras as a key issue on Bryan Nelson's platform, this is a graph that shows the results of engagement:

With this Bryan Nelson was able to have a favorable lead against his opponent, the red light camera campaign was only one of three campaigns that CharlotteAI offered Nelson's campaign, but I did not receive access to the rest of the or was given much more information.

>[Nelson, who had his home annexed into Orange County’s second-biggest city to run for mayor, earned his win by attacking Kilsheimer’s $150,000 salary and his refusal to scrap red-light cameras, which he called a “money grab.” He won handily with 63 percent of the vote.](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange/os-apopka-winter-park-mayor-election-20180313-story.html)
