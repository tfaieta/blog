Oooooh-weeee, my first post! This blog is my defiance with Medium not being able to host custom domains anymore. It's built with GatsbyJS + Firebase Hosting, if you want to learn more about Gatsby, feel free to go to their website https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ and then also check out this article written by Emmanuel Yusufu https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481 . One more resource in case you want to use Firebase Hosting https://heygrady.com/first-launch/ .

Why is this blog called Tiny Wins? Because as a designer and a software developer my life is filled with tiny wins. In this blog, I plan to document as many tiny wins as I can.I'm going to post once a week. If you'd like to reach out to me to talk about anything tweet me @tfaieta. 

Thanks! =)
