# [Tess](http://tess.fm)
A software company that focuses on making products for podcast listeners and creators. I started Tess with my cofounder Nick (both technichal) out of a love for audio and podcasts. Our love of listening to podcasts drove us to make what we thought was missing from the
industry.

##### The Issue:
Users should be able to create quality podcasts from their phones. We also noticed that there were many barriers to entry to maintain a podcast (high cost of hosting + distribution), we thought that this was holding back podcasting in general. We also wanted to make a podcast player that makes us really happy and enhances browsing and sharing features.

##### My Role:
Managed end-to-end product development cycle, from feedback to shipment. Oversaw strategic execution of the Companyâ€™s mission in the performance and appeal of Tess. Designed and engineered a cross-platform product.

##### Output:
Tess podcasting app in both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tess-podcast-app/id1409521849?ls=1&mt=8) & [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tess). Web will be live at [app.tess.fm](app.tess.fm). I continue to manage Tess and will be open-sourcing our codebase in the near future.`)}
