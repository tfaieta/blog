Hi, I'm Tony. I like to design and build software that helps people create interesting and helpful content.

Right now I am working on a podcasting platform called [Tess](https://tess.fm/), we're an all-in-one podcast solution for creators and we also made a really cool player for listeners. You can download Tess for iOS [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tess-podcast-app/id1409521849?ls=1&mt=8) and for Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tess). I'm also an undergrad CS student at the University of Florida where I like to have conversations with others and write about the things that make me happy or about topics that are important to me. If you want to have a conversation feel free to tweet at me [@tfaieta](https://twitter.com/tfaieta).
