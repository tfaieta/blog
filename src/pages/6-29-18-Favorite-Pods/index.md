title: "My Favorite Podcasts"
---

As someone who works for a startup that makes podcasting software people often ask me what my favorite podcasts are. Here are a few that I would say you absolutely have to listen to, in no particular order. Also, I've included links to the websites of each of these podcasts, as well as some episodes of note but you can subscribe to all of these podcast anywhere podcasts are available.

#1. Masters of Scale
Ah, yes, of course. Reid Hoffman's best work (sorry LinkedIn). All jokes aside, Hoffman's interview skills in this podcast are amazing. I really enjoy when teams behind podcasts navigate away from the typical interview format and really try to tell an underlying narrative from the interview in an interesting and creative way. 

Masters of Scale usually interviews a high-profile leader in business or technology (names of note include Sam Altman, Diane Greene, Sheryl Sandberg & Eric Schmidt). Once that interview is recorded, the team goes to work to really try to develop the storyline of the finished episode. It ends up listening like a Netflix documentary, full of bytes of illustrative sounds coming in-and-out, and of course the content given by the guests is highly insightful to anyone with plans on running a company. 

Episodes of Note: 

* [6 Google/Alphabet's Eric Schmidt in Innovation = Managed Chaos](https://mastersofscale.com/eric-schmidt-innovation-managed-chaos/)

* [19 How To Price Your Product To Scale w/ ClassPass' Payal Kadakia](https://mastersofscale.com/payal-kadakia-how-to-price-your-product-to-scale/)

* [20 Never Underestimate Your First Idea w/ Twitter/Medium's Ev Williams](https://mastersofscale.com/ev-williams-never-underestimate-your-first-idea-2/)

#2. The Daily
Sometimes amazing, sometimes not, but always informative. The Daily is hosted by Michael Barbaro, who guides you along the story of the day which most times is a deep look at a topic that is trending among the news. He brings in experts from the Times and his network and it makes for a nice and short daily listen, ~20 min. 

I listen to this podcast everyday with my coffee and it does a great job to inform me on what is going on. I don't use social media that much and what I do use I limit so I use The Daily to stay well informed on trending topics in the news.

Also on Saturdays they release an episode of another podcast called "Caliphate" on The Daily's feed and that makes for a good listen as well. Since The Daily is a daily podcast there aren't many that I can recommend off the top of my head.

The Daily is posted at 5am EST every week day and you can listen to all the episodes [here](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily).

#3. StartUp (Season 1)
Podcast history was made when Alex Blumberg documented his journey about starting a podcast media company, now called Gimlet Media. The first 14 episodes of StartUp is the first series I recommend to anyone that asks me about listening to podcasts. Why? Because Alex really opened up the door into his life for the audience, you go through the story of building Gimlet Media with him, the ups and the downs, confusions, breakdowns, naming, pitching, everything. 

It's pure storytelling, although being a media 'tech' company's story, it's a story for everyone. After the first season, Gimlet Media was a venture-backed startup and things were going well for them, Alex stopped documenting after the fourteenth episode. I try to check out the latest episodes every once in a while but it's nothing like the first season. 

Season 1 is made up of episodes 1–14 and you can listen to episode 1 [here](https://www.gimletmedia.com/startup/1-how-not-to-pitch-a-billionaire#episode-player).

#4. The Ground Up Show
Hosted by Matt D'Avella, most known for his work in directing the award-winning film [Minimalism](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460). If you haven't watched the film and are interested in living more with less then check it out, it's a great introduction to the lifestyle.

The Ground Up Show surprisingly isn't about minimalism, D'Avella talks with comedians, rappers, musicians, YouTubers, and other creatives about their creative process and how they get things done. I particularly like the way how D'Avella asks the hard questions, trying to never stay too much on the surface and go deep into the process or the story behind the guest. What that means is that throughout the interview you can hear real ways on how people have changed their mindset and have become more successful. 

Something about The Ground Up Show that I must point out is that if you don't recognize someones names in the episodes that it's completely okay and that they all are talented and have something they can teach others. 

The audio is super crisp, they're long (which I prefer), the messages are deep, questions are well researched, and Matt is a great host.

Episodes of Note:

* [Reprogram Your Mind w/ Dan Harris](https://mattdavella.com/043)

* [The Process w/ Colin and Samir](https://mattdavella.com/062)

* [The Important Things w/ The Minimalists](https://mattdavella.com/033)

#5. WorkLife w/ Adam Grant
I'm a really big fan of podcasts that think of every episode as one complete narrative from beginning to end. Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist who analyzes some of the most unconventional places of work out there and unveils the inner workings at how these companies work so well. 

They wrapped up their first season a couple months ago, so you can binge listen to it now. I'd listen to all of them and definitely listen to the bonus episode with Malcom Gladwell. 

You can listen to WorkLife [here](https://www.ted.com/series/worklife-with-adam-grant).



#Conclusion
One last point I'd like to drive home, be open-minded in the podcasts that you're listening to. It doesn't always have to be a high profile CEO as a guest to be able to share information that can probably affect your day-to-day in a positive way. Often times it's the people that you don't know that give the best advice because they don't have hundreds of people they represent or a board to report to. 

There are some other good pods that I've been getting into lately, but they don't have that many episodes to where I can say that they are my favorites, feel free to check them out. 

* [Upstream by Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6ENr5Rmd3l2Y4ac3KJNpZ3)

* [The Colin and Samir Podcast](https://www.colinandsamir.com/the-podcast/)

I will be adding a “library” of podcasts on my website in the next few days and will be updating it frequently, so feel free to check on that whenever you need good podcast recommendations. I’ll update this post with the link when I do.

Thanks for reading!
