# Hi and Welcome

This is what makes up [tfaieta.com](tfaieta.com)

## Installation

If you want to run this site locally:

- `git clone`
- Install the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) CLI: `npm i -g gatsby-cli`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gatsby develop`

To ship it out run `gatsby build` first.

Feel free to use it if you want as a template for your site. I will be writing a tutorial on how to use Firebase to host
a site like this for free, once that is up I'll post it here.
